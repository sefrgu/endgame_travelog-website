			Hi, We are Team End Game. Welcome to our Personal Travel Blog!<br>
			We're originally from the Philippines. We are the crazy dreamers and with an insatiable desire for travel and adventure who could<br>
			never settle for an ordinary life or conform with the norm.
		</p>
		<p class="p4">
			We travel to grow as a person, to meet others who inspire and educate us and to hopefully do the same in return, to have our life<br>
			enriched by the beauty and diversity of this amazing world and to have our eyes, mind and heart opened wide.
		</p>
			<p class="p5">
			We travel to make the most of our time on Earth, to make everyday count, instead of counting down the days till the weekend or to<br>
			a 2 week vacation- because life is simply too short for us to live it any other way!
		</p>
			<p class="p6">
			Still, most of the time it's easier to carry on with the routine of the daily grind, always dreaming that one day you will take that trip,<br>
			than that take that leap and leave your comfort zone.
